These stuff are givens but no harm in a few refreshers:
• Contact approach at or below 18,000 feet AGL around 50 miles from the airport. 
• Don’t “check in” then request FF, an approach (ILS, VIS) or radar vectors. It’s unnecessary and may be viewed by some controllers as spam. Pick one!
• Be prompt in responding to instructions!
• When cleared for an ILS approach you are entrusted to turn onto the localizer once its established. Furthermore, call inbound on the ILS or VIS depending on which you were cleared for. If you are on radar vectors, the generic inbound call will suffice.
• By the book, you’re on the runway until the entirety of the aircraft is over the hold short line. Even if you are off the runway pavement, you are considered on the runway if you’re not on the other side. Let’s get off the runway as quickly as possible so others may use it.

Remember we are all ambassadors of this highly regarded organization and should act accordingly. Let’s have fun!
